Feature: Subtraction
	As Callie, a calculating individual
	I want to quickly find the difference between two numbers
	so that I am not tired out by doing mental arithmetic all day

Scenario Outline: Find the result of subtracting two numbers
	Given I am a Calculating Individual
	And I was able to switch on the calculator
	When I attempt to subtract: the number '<subtractor>' from the number '<subtractee>'
	Then I should see the answer '<result>'

Examples:
| subtractor | subtractee | result |
| 0          |          0 |      0 |
| 0          |          1 |      1 |
| 1          |          1 |      0 |
| 5          |         10 |      5 |
