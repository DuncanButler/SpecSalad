	As callie. a calculating individual
	I want to quickly find out the sum of some numbers
	So that I am not tired out by doing mental arithmetic all day

Scenario Outline: Find the sum of two numbers
	Given I am a Calculating Individual
	And I was able to switch on the calculator
	When I attempt to add: the number '<first_number>' to the number '<second_number>'
	Then I should see the answer '<result>'

Examples:

|          0 |           1 |    1 |
